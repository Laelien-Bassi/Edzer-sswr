# Spatial Statistics with R course materials

Materials used in the course [Spatial Statistics with
R](https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/spatial-statistics/),
held Mar 11-15, 2024, online.

## Day 1: Introduction to spatial data

* Introduction to spatial data, support, coordinate reference systems
* Introduction to spatial statistical data types: point patterns, geostatistical data, lattice data
* Is spatial dependence a fact? And is it a curse, or a blessing?
* Spatial sampling, design-based and model-based inference
* Intro to point patterns and point processes, observation window, first and second order properties

## Day 2: Point Pattern data

* Point patterns, density functions
* Interactions of point processes
* Simulating point process
* Modelling density as a function of external variables

## Day 3: Geostatistical data

* Stationarity of mean, stationarity of covariance
* Estimating spatial covariance and semivariance
* Modelling the variogram
* Kriging interpolation
* Conditional simulation

## Day 4: Machine Learning methods applied to spatial data

* Data: coverages as predictors
* Pitfalls: independence, known predictors, clustered data
* Model assessment, cross validation strategies

## Day 5: Big spatial datasets

* What is big?
* Large vector datasets
* Large raster datasets, image collections and data cubes
* Cloud solutions, cloud platforms, platform lock-in
