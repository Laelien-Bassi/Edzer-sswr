    "text": "1.2 Spatial vs. Geospatial\n\nSpatial refers (physical) spaces, 2- or 3-dimensional (\\(R^2\\) or \\(R^3\\))\n\nMost often spatial statistics considers 2-dimensional problems\n3-d: meteorology, climate science, geophysics, groundwater hydrology, aeronautics, …\n\n\n“Geo” refers to the Earth\nFor Earth coordinates, we always need a datum, consisting of an ellipsoid (shape) and the way it is fixed to the Earth (origin)\n\nThe Earth is modelled by an ellipsoid, which is nearly round\nIf we consider Earth-bound areas as flat, for larger areas we get the distances wrong\nWe can (and do) also work on \\(S^2\\), the surface of a sphere, rather than \\(R^2\\), to get distances right, but this creates a number of challenges (such as plotting on a 2D device)\n\n\nNon-geospatial spaces could be:\n\nAssociated with other bodies (moon, Mars)\nAstrophysics, places/directions in the universe\nLocations in a building (where we use “engineering coordinates”, relative to a building corner and orientation)\nMicroscope images\nMRT scans (3-D), places in a human body\nlocations on a genome?\n\n\n\n\nCodelibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(sf)\n# Linking to GEOS 3.12.1, GDAL 3.8.3, PROJ 9.3.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\npar(mar = c(2,2,0,0) + .1)\nne_countries() |&gt; st_geometry() |&gt; plot(axes=TRUE)\n\n\n\nworld map, with longitude and latitude map linearly to x and y (Plate Caree)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Statistics\n\n\n\n… or what are statistics?\n\nstatistic: a descriptive measure summarising some data\nStatistics: a scientific disciplin aiming at modelling data, using probability theory\n\nwhere does randomness come from? Design-based vs. model-based\nare parameters random or fixed? Bayesian vs. frequentist\ninference, prediction, simulations\n\n\nTypical approach: observation = signal + noise, noise modelled by random variables\n\n\n\nDesign-based statistics\nIn design-based statistics, randomness comes from random sampling. Consider an area \\(B\\), from which we take samples \\[z(s),\ns \\in B,\\] with \\(s\\) a location for instance two-dimensional: \\(s_i =\n\\{x_i,y_i\\}\\). If we select the samples randomly, we can consider \\(S \\in B\\) a random variable, and \\(z(S)\\) a random sample. Note the randomness in \\(S\\), not in \\(z\\).\nTwo variables \\(z(S_1)\\) and \\(z(S_2)\\) are independent if \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) are sampled independently. For estimation we need to know the inclusion probabilities, which need to be non-negative for every location.\nIf inclusion probabilities are constant (simple random sampling; or complete spatial randomness: day 2, point patterns) then we can estimate the mean of \\(Z(B)\\) by the sample mean \\[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n\nz(s_j).\\] This also predicts the value of a randomly chosen observation \\(z(S)\\). It cannot be used to predict the value \\(z(s_0)\\) for a non-randomly chosen location \\(s_0\\); for this we need a model.\nModel-based statistics\nModel-based statistics assumes randomness in the measured responses; consider a regression model \\(y = X\\beta + e\\), where \\(e\\) is a random variable and as a consequence \\(y\\), the response variable is a random variable. In the spatial context we replace \\(y\\) with \\(z\\), and capitalize it to indicate it is a random variable, and write \\[Z(s) = X(s)\\beta + e(s)\\] to stress that\n\n\n\\(Z(s)\\) is a random function (random variables \\(Z\\) as a function of \\(s\\))\n\n\\(X(s)\\) is the matrix with covariates, which depend on \\(s\\)\n\n\n\\(\\beta\\) are (spatially) constant coefficients, not depening on \\(s\\)\n\n\n\\(e(s)\\) is a random function with mean zero and covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\)\n\n\nIn the regression literature this is called a (linear) mixed model, because \\(e\\) is not i.i.d. If \\(e(s)\\) contains an iid component \\(\\epsilon\\) we can write this as\n\\[Z(s) = X(s)\\beta + w(s) + \\epsilon\\]\nwith \\(w(s)\\) the spatial signal, and a noise compenent e.g. due to measurement error.\nPredicting \\(Z(s_0)\\) will involve (GLS) estimation of \\(\\beta\\), but also prediction of \\(e(s_0)\\) using correlated, nearby observations (day 3: geostatistics).\nDesign- or model-based?\n\ndesign-based requires a random sample, if that is the case it needs no further assumptions\nmodel-based requires stationarity assumptions to estimate \\(\\Sigma\\)\n\nmodel-based is typically more effective for interpolation problems\ndesign-based can be most effective when estimation e.g. average mapping errors\nUsing coordinates as covariates?\n\n(day 4)",
