    "text": "1.1 What is special about spatial data?\n\nCoordinates. What are coordinates? Dimension(s)?\nLocation. Does location always involve coordinates?\nTime. If not explicit, there is an implicit time reference. Dimension(s)?\nAttributes. at specific locations we measure specific properties\nQuite often, we want to know where things change (space-time interactions).\nReference systems for space, time, and attributes: what are they?\nSupport: if we have an attribute value associated with a line, polygon or grid cell:\n\ndoes the value summarise all values at points? (line/area/cell support), or\nis the value constant throughout the line/area/cell (point support)?\n\nContinuity:\n\nis a variable spatially continuous? Yes for geostatitical data, no for point patterns\nis an attribute variable continuous? Stevens’s measurement scales: yes if Interval or Ratio.\n\n\n\nSupport: examples\n\nRoad properties\n\nroad type: gravel, brick, asphalt (point support: everywhere on the whole road)\nmean width: block support (summary value)\nminimum width: block support (although the minimum width may be the value at a single (point) location, it summarizes all widths of the road–we no longer know the width at any specific point location)\n\nLand use/land cover\n\nroad type is a land cover type\nwhen we classify e.g. 30 m x 30 m Landsat pixels into a single class, this single class is not constant throughout this pixel\na land cover type like “urban” is associated with a positive support: we don’t say a point in a garden or park is urban, but it is part of a (larger) urban fabric\n\nFurther reading: Chapter 5: Attributes and Support",
