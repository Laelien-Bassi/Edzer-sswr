If not explicit, there is an implicit time reference. Dimension(s)?\nAttributes. at specific locations we measure specific properties\nQuite often, we want to know where things change (space-time interactions).\nReference systems for space, time, and attributes: what are they?\nSupport: if we have an attribute value associated with a line, polygon or grid cell:\n\ndoes the value summarise all values at points? (line/area/cell support), or\nis the value constant throughout the line/area/cell (point support)?\n\nContinuity:\n\nis a variable spatially continuous? Yes for geostatitical data, no for point patterns\nis an attribute variable continuous? Stevens’s measurement scales: yes if Interval or Ratio.\n\n\n\nSupport: examples\n\nRoad properties\n\nroad type: gravel, brick, asphalt (point support: everywhere on the whole road)\nmean width: block support (summary value)\nminimum width: block support (although the minimum width may be the value at a single (point) location, it summarizes all widths of the road–we no longer know the width at any specific point location)\n\nLand use/land cover\n\nwhen we classify e.g. 30 m x 30 m Landsat pixels into a single class, this single class is not constant throughout this pixel\nroad type is a land cover type, but a road never covers a 30 m x 30 m pixel\na land cover type like “urban” is associated with a positive (non-point) support: we don’t say a point in a garden or park is urban, or a point on a roof, but these are part of a (block support) urban fabric\n\nElevation\n\nin principle, we can measure elevation at a point; in practice, every measuring device has a physical (non-point) size\n\nFurther reading: Chapter 5: Attributes and Support",

    "text": "1.3 What is Statistics?\n\nstatistic: a descriptive measure summarising some data\nStatistics: a scientific disciplin aiming at modelling data, using probability theory\n\nwhere does randomness come from? Design-based vs. model-based\nare parameters random or fixed? Bayesian vs. frequentist\ninference, prediction, simulations\n\nTypical approach: observation = signal + noise, noise modelled by random variables\n\n\nDesign-based statistics\nIn design-based statistics, randomness comes from random sampling. Consider an area \\(B\\), from which we take samples \\[z(s),\ns \\in B,\\] with \\(s\\) a location for instance two-dimensional: \\(s_i =\n\\{x_i,y_i\\}\\). If we select the samples randomly, we can consider \\(S \\in B\\) a random variable, and \\(z(S)\\) a random sample. Note the randomness in \\(S\\), not in \\(z\\).\nTwo variables \\(z(S_1)\\) and \\(z(S_2)\\) are independent if \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) are sampled independently. For estimation we need to know the inclusion probabilities, which need to be non-negative for every location.\nIf inclusion probabilities are constant (simple random sampling; or complete spatial randomness: day 2, point patterns) then we can estimate the mean of \\(Z(B)\\) by the sample mean \\[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n\nz(s_j).\\] This also predicts the value of a randomly chosen observation \\(z(S)\\). It cannot be used to predict the value \\(z(s_0)\\) for a non-randomly chosen location \\(s_0\\); for this we need a model.\n\n\nModel-based statistics\nModel-based statistics assumes randomness in the measured responses; consider a regression model \\(y = X\\beta + e\\), where \\(e\\) is a random variable and as a consequence \\(y\\), the response variable is a random variable. In the spatial context we replace \\(y\\) with \\(z\\), and capitalize it to indicate it is a random variable, and write \\[Z(s) = X(s)\\beta + e(s)\\] to stress that\n\n\\(Z(s)\\) is a random function (random variables \\(Z\\) as a function of \\(s\\))\n\\(X(s)\\) is the matrix with covariates, which depend on \\(s\\)\n\\(\\beta\\) are (spatially) constant coefficients, not depening on \\(s\\)\n\\(e(s)\\) is a random function with mean zero and covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\)\n\nIn the regression literature this is called a (linear) mixed model, because \\(e\\) is not i.i.d.\nPredicting \\(Z(s_0)\\) will involve (GLS) estimation of \\(\\beta\\), but also prediction of \\(e(s_0)\\) using correlated, nearby observations (day 3: geostatistics).\n\n\nDesign- or model-based?\n\ndesign-based requires a random sample, if that is the case it needs no further assumptions\nmodel-based requires stationarity assumptions to estimate \\(\\Sigma\\)\nmodel-based is typically more effective for interpolation problems\ndesign-based can be most effective when estimation e.g. average mapping errors\n\n\n\nUsing coordinates as covariates?\n\n(day 4)",
