### Reading materials

From [Spatial Data Science: with applications in R](https://r-spatial.org/book/): 

* Chapter 11: Point Patterns
* Chapter 7: `sf` and `stars`

::: {.callout-tip title="Summary"}

* Intro to `sf` and `stars`
* Intro to `spatstat`
* Point patterns, density functions
* Interactions of point processes
* Simulating point process
* Modelling density as a function of external variables

## Intro to `sf` and `stars`

* Briefly: `sf` provides classes and methods for _simple features_
    * a feature is a "thing", with geometrical properties (point(s), line(s), polygon(s)) and attributes
    * `sf` stores data in `data.frame`s with a list-column (of class `sfc`) that holds the geometries

::: {.callout-tip title="the Simple Feature standard"}

"Simple Feature Access" is an [open standard](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sfa/) for data
with vector geometries. It defines a set of classes for geometries and operations on them.

* "simple" refers to curves that are "simply" represented by points connected by straight lines
* connecting lines are not allowed to [self-intersect](https://r-spatial.org/book/03-Geometries.html#sec-valid)
* polygons can have holes, and have validity constraints: holes cannot extrude the outer ring etc.
* All spatial software uses this: ArcGIS, QGIS, PostGIS, other spatial databases, ...

### Why do all functions in `sf` start with `st_`?

* see [here](https://ecoevo.social/@noamross/112055449473807578)

```{r fig-gdal-fig-nodetails, echo = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
#| out.width: '100%'
#| fig.cap: "**sf** and its dependencies; arrows indicate strong dependency, dashed arrows weak dependency"
knitr::include_graphics("sf_deps.png") 
```

## Intro to `spatstat`



::: {.callout-tip title="MaxEnt"}

You would think that MaxEnt is a point pattern technique, however it

* adds background (absence) points
* fits logistic regression models to the 0/1 data
* ignores space, spatial interactions, distances
* will be discussed on Day 4: **Machine Learning methods applied to spatial data**
